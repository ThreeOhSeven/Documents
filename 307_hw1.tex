The VW emissions scandal violated a great many of the clauses in the Software Engineering Code of Ethics. Engineers and managers are both to blame for this fiasco but it should be shown at least a subset of the clauses of the Code of Ethics that were violated.

\begin{itemize}
	\item 1.03 : The cars could not really pass appropriate tests.
	\item 1.04 : The cars did cause danger to the environment by masquerading as being much worse for the environment than as listed and this was not disclosed.
	\item 1.06 : Making the car emit less when being tested for emissions tests is the antithesis of "be fair and avoid deception".
	\item 3.03 : Failed to identify environmental issues related to work project.
	\item 5.11 : Managers failed to stop engineers from violating the code.
	\item 6.01 : VW failed to develop an organizational environment where acting ethically is favorable.
	\item 6.06 : Did not obey all laws governing their work.
	\item 6.07 : Were not accurate in the description of their work.
	\item 6.12 : Did not express concern over the violation of the code.
	\item 6.13 : Did not report the significant violation of the code to the proper authorities.
	\item 8.08 : As it took a team to create the emissions scandal, there must have been influence to violate the code.
\end{itemize}
